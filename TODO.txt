TODO for OpenDict

Status:
  x -- done
  * -- not finished
  ? -- needs to be discussed


[ ] Let DICT connection be handled as a dictionary and be kept
in Dictionaries menu. Let it have user defined names. Make "Manage
DICT Connections" for that.

[ ] Ability to merge dictionaries in editor

[ ] Suggestions when search is unsuccessfull. Idea: if search gives no
results, drop the last letter of the world (i.e. to make prular to
single); drop another one if not results and repeat this for 3-4
times. Might be enough. An option for such search should be available
in prefernces dialog. This by default should be turned on. A warning
about slow search also should be added.

[ ] Remove option entries for saving window size and position.

[ ] Remember last used dictionary and load it on startup if no default
dictionary specified.
